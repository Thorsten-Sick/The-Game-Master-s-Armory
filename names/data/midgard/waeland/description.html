    <!--COUNTRY DESCRIPTION-->
    <h1>Country description</H1>
		Like many other Midgard countries, Waeland is inspired by an existing country in human history. In this case, it's the vikings. 
    
		<h2>Historical</h2>
    
    <h2>Regional</h2>
    There are some regional gods. Maybe some parts of the names of these gods are put into the names of people. The gods are:<br>
		<ul>
		<li>Asvargr War</li>
		<li>Fjörgynn Fertility</li>
		<li>Vidar Creator of the world</li>
		<li>Wyrd Wisdom</li>
		</ul>
		There are more. But I don't think the others will become part of the name/nickname.

    <h2>Building names</h2>
    Names are build like western european names, sometimes you do not have a family name or the family name is subsituted by a "Beiname" (additional name).
		The "Beinamen" are given to the Waeländer by friends or family. It bases on body attributes ("Einauge"="One eye") or events (good and bad) happening. <br>
		Family can be the simple names of the clan or the first name of mother or father with the attached -son (for son) or -dottir/-daughdir for daughter.
    <h2>Titles</h2>
    <h2>Futharkify</h2>
		To generate names written in runesI wrote futharkify.pl. It is based on the Futhark alphabet.
		It is available with the tools for libnamegen. If you should need it, just ask.
