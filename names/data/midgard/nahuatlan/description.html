    <h2>Building names</h2>
    Children are named by the day (number of the day and month) they are born. To many are dying before they reach their seventh year. Reaching this year, a "Deuter" is visited. This person seeks a vision and offers the new name to the child. This name is added to the children's name. <br>
These names are based on items, because the language and writing system can only handle those names. Maybe some adjective is added. The resulting name can translate to "Smoking Shield" and shield can be drawn as name.
