    <!--COUNTRY DESCRIPTION-->
    <h1>Country description</H1>
		Like many other Midgard countries, Chryseia is inspired by an existing country in human history. In this case, it is Ancient Greek. To create Chryseian names you can take greek names (no names with greek gods) and maybe even some roman/latin names sounding greek.
    
		<h2>Historical</h2>
    
    <h2>Regional</h2>
    There are some regional gods. Maybe some parts of the names of these gods are put into the names of people. The gods are:<br>
		<ul>
		<li>Nea Dea  the mother</li>
		<li>Wredelin  her son, god of wisdom</li>
		<li>Jakchos  wine and party</li>
		</ul>

    <h2>Building names</h2>
    Names are build like western european names, sometimes you do not have a family name.
		To specify the persone more exactly, the city where he is from is added to the name with the word "apo" (from). The more important a person is, the better he/she has to be identified. While it is easy to talk about the (only locally known) Xanthippe, it is difficult to identify aXanthippe from a different town. So family names and city names are added for persons not only important locally.
    <h2>Titles</h2>
    <h2>Greekify</h2>
		To generate names written in greek letters Christina Schmidt helped me to write 		
		greekify.pl.
		It is available with the tools for libnamegen. If you should need it, just ask. Greekify is not perfect, but the basic rules for writing greek words are implemented.
