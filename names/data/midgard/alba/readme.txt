The source for this was:
- The Alba Source Book
- Scottish whiskys. I removed some well known. But they result in very good village names :-)
  Ben* are mountains, so I removed them also. Glen* are valleys. They can stay.
  Every whisky gourmet may forgive me if he plays midgard and his mouth waters.
