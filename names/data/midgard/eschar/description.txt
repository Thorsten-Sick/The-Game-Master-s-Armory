Rules:

son of = ibn or ben
daughter of = bint

Sometimes the own name van vanish (if the father, grandfather... is well known and important)
Bin Abdullah
Ben Abdullah
Bint Abdullah

Hadschi You were a pilgrim to the main religious side (real=Mekka, Midgard=Kushan)

Father of (if the son is important) = Abu 
Mother of = Umma

Abu Harun Sinan bin Ja'far 
Where Sinan is the own name

Talib Harun = student of Harun, at end of name
Katib Harun = scribe of Harun

al-Mekneschi = From Meknesch, here there can be also the name of the job...


And I thought russian is difficult.
