ABOUT THE LANGUAGE
------------------

English name: Catalan
Real Name: Català (pronunciation: /kata'la/)

Catalan is a Romance language that is spoken or understood by more than
10 millions people.

It's the official language of Andorra and co-official in the Spanish
autonomous communities (once a free country, the "Països Catalans") of
