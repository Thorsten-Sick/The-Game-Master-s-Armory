    <!--COUNTRY DESCRIPTION-->
    <h1>Country description</H1>
    Germany is a country in the middle of Europe. With borders to France, Suisse Austria, Poland...
    In the south west the neighbour Suisse and France influence the names. This kind of influence can be observed in other regions of Germany as well.<br>
    After the World War II the winning armies kept military bases in Germany. French in south west, Americans in most of the rest of germany. Eastern Germany was seperated from the rest of the country as "DDR" by the Soviet army. These military bases resulted in marriages and it is not uncommon to see people with mixed names parts (German first name, American family name, father is an American soldier and the mother a German woman) close to these bases.<br>
Other sources of foreign names are foreigners comming into Germany about 10 to 20 years after the second world war. These people came to rebuild Germany and had it very easy to get jobs. Most of them came from Italy or Turkey. Most of them found friends here and stayed.<br>

     <h2>Historical</h2>
    Many family names were generated in medieval times from the job the ancestor of this name-line had. "Müller" is Miller, Schmid comes from the German word for blacksmith and so on.<br>
The first names were taken out of the Bible (Christian, Lukas, Markus). In more modern times these names can come from everywhere.<br>
	Important: After Hitler (his friends, allies and most of th Germans) destroyed Germany, half of the world and murdered hundreds of thousands of people <b>no one</b> is named Adolf anymore. Don't believe Hollywood.

    <h2>Regional</h2>
    Germany was lots of small kingdoms about 100 years ago. And still family and first names are different in the south or the north of germany. Dialects differ very much up to people from north Germany not being able to understand people from the south.<br>

    <h2>Building names</h2>
    Normally parents chose a first name for their child. There are different names for girls and boys. Invented names are not allowed in Germany (in the USA you can name your child whatever you want AFAIK). Children can get additional first names ( often used to please some uncle or aunt by naming the child after them). This can allow the person to chose his second(third...) first-name as the name she wants to be called.<br>
    If two people get married, normally the woman takes the family name of the man as her family name. Some years ago it became possible to chose one of the family names to be the one for the nely wed. It is even possible to build a new family name out of the family names of the two persons adding a '-' sign. Frau Silke Müller and Herr Thomas Schmidt can become Thomas Müller-Schmidt and Silke Müller-Schmidt. But this is still uncommon. So most of the people use the name of the man.<br>
    <h2>Titles</h2>
    Normally you use the titles "Herr" (Mister) and "Frau" (Mrs.) in front of the family name if you are not closely related to the person you are adressing. The german "Fräulein" for an unmarried woman is not used anymore. The grandparent generation sometimes still uses it, younger people think of it as un-respectful because this way the status of a woman is defined by her marriage status.<br>
   "von" in the name marks noble ancestors. But very often, the only thing left to those people having the "von" in the name are those three letters. You will find it used often in novels and films (likely because it is a typical german relic).<br>
	The German language has to different grammatical forms to address a person. For people younger than you, friends and family it is the "du" (second person). To address older people, people being your boss, strangers...it is the more respectful "sie" (hird person). The younger generation (&lt; 30 years) uses the "du" more often.
