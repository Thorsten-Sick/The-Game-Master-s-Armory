#The Phoenicians were descendants of the Canaanites. They lived north of Canaan in a narrow 
#strip of land by the Mediterranean Sea. They were known for their timber, especially cedar and 
#cypress, their purple dye, which they made from local murex shells, and their dyed wool. 
#Phoenician ships and merchants were an important presence in the Mediterranean Sea and the Red 
#Sea. The city of Tyre founded colonies at Carthage in North Africa, on the island of Cyprus, 
#and perhaps in mining areas in north Greece between the eleventh and ninth centuries BC. Other 
#Phoenician cities formed their own colonies throughout the area, including one at Cades (Cadiz) 
#on the Atlantic coast of Spain. The major Phoenician cities included Tyre, Sidon, Byblos 
#Phoenician Gebal), and Arvad. The cities of Phoenicia were dominated by the Egyptians, 
#Amorites, the Hyksos, Assyrians, Babylonians, Persians, Greeks, and Romans at various times in 
#their long history. The city-states of Phoenicia never united to form a kingdom of Phoenicia.
